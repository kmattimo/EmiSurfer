##Create ambient soundscapes with an electric guitar and electromagnetic interference from a smartphone

A classic annoyance for any engineer recording single-coil guitars, I accidentally discovered that the EMF noise from a smartphone sounded pretty cool through a hot-driven amp and a wah-wah. We created an app designed to enable any guitar player to pull out their phone and create cool soundscapes- for sampling, ambient pads, or live looping. 

Usage: Hold the phone near the active guitar pickup(s). Manipulate the sounds created with  the application interface, physical placement, and the rest of the guitar signal chain. 

Due to hardware differences, every device model sounds different! Phone bodies have different 'hot zones' that emit noise.
